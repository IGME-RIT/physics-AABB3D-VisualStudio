Description:
This is an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box collision test. This is in 3D.
Contains two cubes, one that is stationary and one that is moving. They are bounded
by AABBs (Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes) and when these AABBs collide, the moving
object "bounces" on the X-axis (because that is the only direction the object is
moving). The algorithm will detect collision along any axis, but will not be able
to output the axis of collision because it doesn't know. Thus, we assume X and
hardcode in the X-axis bounce. If you would like to know the axis of collision,
try out the Swept AABB collision.
There is a physics timestep such that every update runs at the same delta time,
regardless of how fast or slow the computer is running. The cubes will not be the
exact same as their AABBs, since they are rotating while the AABBs are aligned on
the X-Y-Z axes but should you wish to see the AABBs match the cubes perfectly,
simply comment out the rotate lines (obj1->Rotate, obj2->Rotate).
